## Animated CSS-only icons

CSS icons are good because they're scalable, totally editable, easily animatable and are often faster to load than icon-fonts (often smaller files, less prone to the dreaded FOUC). Also, it's fun to misuse CSS.

The icons are divided between those that only need one tag and those that need more markup.
